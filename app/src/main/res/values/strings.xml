    <string name="test_description">Every child comes into the world full of promise, and none more so than Chappie: he is gifted, special, a prodigy. Like any child, Chappie will come under the influence of his surroundings—some good, some bad—and he will rely on his heart and soul to find his way in the world and become his own man. But there\'s one thing that makes Chappie different from any one else: he is a robot.</string>

    <string name="test_review">One of the best movies Disney has created in the last years. Smart plot with a great background topic talking about the differences, stereotypes, prejudices and joining the tendency of giving women more important roles.\n\nIt has still several gaps to fill and enhance on the latest point but it is, IMHO, a milestone in the right direction.\n\nThe characters work pretty well and it is funny when needed and not too full of cheesy songs.</string>
